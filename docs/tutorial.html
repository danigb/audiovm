    <h1>Audio Virtual Machine</h1>

    <p>A tutorial by Graham Wakefield & Charlie Roberts published originally
      <a href="https://worldmaking.github.io/workshop_nime_2017/">here.</a>
    </p>

    <p>We have designed a target language that captures some essential concepts for a musical live coding context, such as playing
      notes and looping patterns. It is intentionally limited to make it fairly easy to learn, yet also intentionally designed
      to make it possible to express a wide variety of ideas. It is not designed to be succinct -- that's the job of the
      user-facing language you create! The target language is a bit like the instruction sequences real compilers use, in
      that it is a list of commands. However ours can also have nested structures as lists of lists. A simple example is
      a pattern that plays a note every beat:
    </p>

    <pre class="runnable">
      [["@pluck", 1, "@wait"], "@loop"]
    </pre>

    <h2>Sounds</h2>

    <p>The VM comes with a small number of instruments to get things going. Here's a plucked string instrument. There are two
      ways to trigger it. You can use "@pluck:note" to set the one parameter:</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
      [440, "freq", "@pluck:note"]
    </pre>

    <p>or a list of parameters if they are wrapped in an array:</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
      [[880, "freq", 0.25, "amp"], "@pluck:note"]
    </pre>

    <p>Also, you can set the frequency and amplitude independently with the "@inst:set-param" syntax, and just use @pluck to
      trigger the note using these values. This can allow a bit more flexibility in how these values are calculated:
    </p>

    <pre class="runnable">
      ["@pluck"]
    </pre>
    <pre class="runnable">
      [330, "@pluck:set-freq", 0.5, "@pluck:set-amp, "@pluck"]
    </pre>

    <p>There are also some percussion sounds, which either grab amplitude from the context (set using @set-amp), or specify
      it using the :note variants:
    </p>

    <pre class="runnable">
      [1, "amp", "@hat:note"]
    </pre>
    <pre class="runnable">
      [1, "amp", "@kick:note"]
    </pre>
    <pre class="runnable">
      [1, "amp", @snare:note"]
    </pre>
    <pre class="runnable">
      [1, "amp", "@hat:note"]
    </pre>
    <pre class="runnable">
      [1, "@kick:set-amp", "@kick"]
    </pre>
    <pre class="runnable">
      [[1, "@snare:set-amp", "@snare"]
    </pre>
    <pre class="runnable">
      [[
        [
          [0.3, 1], "@iter", "amp", @hat:note",
          0.125, "@wait"
        ], 8, "@repeat", 
      ], 4, "@repeat"]
    </pre>

    <h2>Syntax sugar</h2>

    <p>Since writing all programs in stack notation is counter-intuitive, there's a <code>@>></code> macro that reverses the
      order of the current array.</p>
    <p>The previous example can be written as:</p>

    <pre class="unnable">
      ["@>>", "@repeat", 4, [
        "@>>", "@repeat", 8, [
          [0.3, 1], "@iter", "amp", @hat:note", 
          0.125, "@wait"
        ]
      ]]

    <h2>Repetition and parallelism</h2>

    <p>A list with several events normally happens at the same time:</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
      [
        220, "freq", "@pluck:note",
        330, "freq", "@pluck:note",
      ]
    </pre>

    <p>Unless you add a n,@wait:</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
      [
        220, "freq", "@set", "@pluck",
        1, "@wait",
        330, "freq", "@set", "@pluck"
      ]
    </pre>

    <p>Here's how to do something a specific number of times: </p>

    <pre class="runnable">
      [
        [ "@pluck", 0.25, "@wait" ], 4, "@repeat"
      ]
    </pre>

    <pre class="runnable">
    [
      4, "@repeat", [ "@pluck", 0.25, "@wait" ],
      [220, "freq", "@set"], "@pluck"
    ]
  </pre>

    <p>Here's how to do something forever:</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
[
"@loop", [ "@pluck", 0.25, "@wait" ]
]
  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>


    <p>Note that @loop will run the pattern that follows it in parallel, which means that you can keep on triggering more things
      after it. So it's easy to set up a bunch of parallel processes: </p>

    <pre class="runnable">
[
    "@loop", [ 0.5, "@kick-note", 2, "@wait" ],
    "@loop", [ 0.3, "@hat-note", 0.4, "@wait" ],
    "@loop", [ 550, 0.5, "@pluck-note", 0.6, "@wait" ],
    "@loop", [ 330, 0.4, "@pluck-note", 0.2, "@wait" ],
    "@loop", [ 110, 0.6, "@pluck-note", 12, "@wait" ]
]
  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <p>And to run something in parallel without looping it, just use @fork []:</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
[
    "@loop", [
        "@kick",
        "@fork", [
            0.25, "@wait",
            550, 1, "@pluck-note",
            0.33, "@wait",
            660, 1, "@pluck-note"
        ],
        1, "@wait"
    ]
]
  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <p>This is also handy for setting up loops with different start times:</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
[
    "@loop", ["@kick", 1, "@wait"],
    "@fork", [0.5, "@wait",
        "@loop", ["@hat", 1, "@wait"]
    ]
]
  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <h2>Expressions</h2>

    <p>Anywhere that a number would go, you can insert an expression. Here are some fun expressions.</p>

    <p>Here's picking a value at random from a list, instead of giving the freq and amp values as numbers:</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
  [
      "@loop", [
          ["@quote", [330, 440, 550, 660], "@pick"],
          ["@quote", [1, 0.7, 0.4], "@pick"],
          "@pluck-note",
          0.25, "@wait"
      ]
  ]
  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <p>Here's alternating between a set of values in a list, one at a time:</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
  [
      "@loop", [
          ["@quote", [330, 440, 550, 660], "@iter"],
          ["@quote", [1, 0.7, 0.4], "@iter"],
          "@pluck-note",
          0.25, "@wait"
      ]
  ]
  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <p>Here's way to set the probability of something happening. Note that two lists have to be given after the "@chance"; either
      the first is run (if the chance happens), else the other one will be run.</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
  [
      "@loop", [
          "@fork", [
              0.2,
              "@chance",
              ["@snare"],
              ["@tom"]
          ],
          "@hat", 0.25, "@wait"
      ]
  ]
  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <p>If you don't care about the 'else' case, just put an empty list [] or null. But you must put something, or else the virtual
      machine will get corrupted, and who knows what might happen.</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
  [
      "@loop", [
          "@fork", [
              0.1,
              "@chance",
              ["@snare"],
              []
          ],
          "@hat", 0.25, "@wait"
      ]
  ]
  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <p>Another way of getting some randomness is to use the @rand (which generates a number between 0 and 1), @srand (which
      generates a number between -1 and 1), and n,@randi (which generates a number between 0 and n-1):</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
  [
      "@loop", [
          "@rand", "amp", "@set",
          "@pluck",
          0.25, "@wait"
      ]
  ]
  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <pre class="runnable">
  [
      "@loop", [
          "@pluck",
          [3, "@randi"], "@wait"
      ]
  ]
  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <p>There are several basic math functions that can be used to map numbers into useful ranges. Note that most math functions
      require the arguments first, e.g. use [a,b,@+] to add a and b:</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
  [
      "@loop", [
          [[[4, "@randi"], 1, "@+"], 110, "@*"], "freq", "@set",
          "@pluck",
          0.25, "@wait"
      ]
  ]
  </pre>
    <pre class="runnable">
  [
      "@loop", [
          [["@srand", 10, "@*"], 110, "@+"], "freq", "@set",
          "@pluck",
          0.25, "@wait"
      ]
  ]
  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <h2>Get, set, and let</h2>

    <p><b>FIXME: this is no longer true. At this moment you can only use
    @set, @let or @get preceding the variable name</b></p>

    <p>The @set-freq etc. are really just examples of creating named values ("variables") that can be re-used again later. Actually
      you can use @set-anything to create whatever variables you like, and use @get-anything to retrieve them. Mainly this
      is useful when you want to re-use something a few times:
    </p>

    <pre class="runnable">
[
    "@loop", [
        [[[4, "@randi"], 2, "@+"], 110, "@*"], "fq", "@set",
        "fq", "@get", 0.6, "@pluck-note",
        ["fq", "@get", 1.5, "@mul"], 0.6, "@pluck-note",
        0.25, "@wait"
    ]
]
  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <p>By default @set-anything will apply globally, so you can modulate a parameter from one loop while using it in another:</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
[
    "@loop", [
        [[[4, "@randi"], 2, "@+"], 110, "@*"], "fq", "@set",
        1, "@wait"
    ],
    "@loop", [
        "fq", "@get", 0.6, "@pluck-note",
        ["fq", "@get", 1.5, "@mul"], 0.6, "@pluck-note",
        0.25, "@wait"
    ]
]
  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <p>If globalism isn't what you care for, you can make a name "local" to a particular loop by using @let-anything. Once you
      have @let- a variable in a particular @loop (or @fork) pattern, it will remain local to that pattern. Generally, use
      @let if you want some value that is only used within a pattern, and @set if you want something global.</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
[
    "@loop", [
        [[[4, "@randi"], 1, "@+"], 110, "@mul"], "fq", "@let",
        "fq", "@get", 0.6, "@pluck-note",
        ["fq", "@get", 1.5, "@mul"], 0.6, "@pluck-note",
        0.25, "@wait"
    ],
    "@loop", [
        [[[4, "@randi"], 5, "@+"], 110, "@mul"], "fq", "@let",
        "fq", "@get", 1, "@pluck-note",
        ["fq", "@get", 1.5, "@mul"], 0.6, "@pluck-note",
        0.25, "@wait"
    ]
]
  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <p>One use for this is to repeatedly modify a value, such as for a counter, or a decay:</p>

    <pre class="runnable">
[
    "@loop", [
        1, "a", "@let",
        8, "@repeat", [
            "a", "@get", "@snare-note",
            0.25, "@wait",
            "a", "@get", 0.6, "@*", "a", "@set"
        ]
    ]
]
  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <p>The only thing special about @set-freq is that the name "freq" is used by @pluck. That is, @pluck is equivalent to: ["@get-freq",
      "@get-amp", "@pluck-note"]. Similarly for @set-amp etc.</p>

    <h2>Independently parallel</h2>

    <p>Say you want to be able to launch a loop, then let it keep running while you launch another. And say you want to redefine
      it while it plays, or stop it. To do that you need to name it. We can do that via "@spawn".</p>

    <pre class="runnable">[
    "foo", "@spawn", [220, 0.5, "@pluck-note", 0.50, "@wait"],
    "bar", "@spawn", [330, 0.5, "@pluck-note", 0.75, "@wait"],
    3, "@wait",
    "foo", "@spawn", [110, 0.5, "@pluck-note", 1, "@wait"]
]</pre>

    <pre class="runnable">[
    "foo", "@spawn", [440, 0.5, "@pluck-note", 0.5, "@wait"]
]</pre>

    <pre class="runnable">[
    "bar", "@spawn", [110, 0.5, "@pluck-note", 1, "@wait"]
]</pre>

    <p>Click to change the "foo" part:</p>
    <pre class="runnable">["foo", "@stop"]
</pre>

    <pre class="runnable">[
    "bar", "@stop"
]  </pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <pre class="runnable">[

    ],
    "@loop",[

    ]

    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <h2>Tempo and rate</h2>
    <p>There's a global tempo that can be manipulated:</p>

    <pre class="runnable">[
    0.4,"amp","@set",
    "@loop",[
      ["@quote",[120, 80, 60],"@iter"],"@set-bpm",4,"@wait"
    ],
    "@loop",[
        ["@quote",[14,15,16,17,18],"@iter",44,"@mul"],"freq","@set",
        "@pluck", 0.25, "@wait"
    ],0.125,"@wait",
    "@loop",[
        ["@quote",[32,34,36,24,30],"@iter",44,"@mul"],"freq","@set",
        "@pluck", 0.25, "@wait"
    ]
]</pre>
    <button class="button-secondary" onclick="vm.run(['@stop-all'], false)">Stop</button>

    <p>You can scale the current rate:</p>
    <pre class="runnable">[
